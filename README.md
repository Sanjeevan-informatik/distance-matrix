# Pairwise sequence alignment

A dot matrix depiction, sometimes known as a dot plot, is arguably the most traditional method of comparing two nucleotide or amino acid sequences. Using a matrix where the columns represent the character positions in sequence 1 and the rows represent the character positions in sequence 2, two sequences are visually compared in a dot plot. If the ith character of sequence 1 matches the jth character of sequence 2, a dot is put in position I j).
